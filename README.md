# python-api-challenge
Use Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

# Key trends observed
Based on the random data of cities obtained, following observations can be made:
1. As we move towards equator the temparature gets warmer
2. As you move away from the equator towards NORTH (positive latitude) the temparature drops or cools down as compared to the temparature on SOUTH (negative latitude). NOTE: This might be because we have Max temparature taken into consideration.
3. The latitude has no discernible relationship with cloudiness & wind speed. No trend observed.
