# python-api-challenge
Use Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

# Key trends observed
Based on the random data of cities obtained, following observations can be made:
1. As we move towards equator the temperature gets warmer
2. As you move away from the equator towards NORTH (positive latitude) the temperature drops or cools down as compared to the temperature on SOUTH (negative latitude). NOTE: This might be because we have Max temperature taken into consideration.
3. The latitude has no discernible relationship with cloudiness & wind speed
